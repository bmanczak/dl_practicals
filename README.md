# UvA Deep Learning Course 2020 - Practicals

## Overview

This repo contains my solutions to the 3 assignments of the course Deep Learning realised at the Univeristy of Amsterdam in Fall 2020. Among others, here you can find **PyTorch** implemenations and/or theory of the following:

### Assignment 1:
- MLP (additionally coded in NumPy from scratch)
- Custom module for Layer Normalization
- CNN VGG13 architecture with skip connections.

### Assignment 2:
- Vanilla LSTM 
- bi-LSTM
- Application: LSTM for text generation
- Graph Neural Networks (theory only)

### Assignment 3:
- VAE
- GAN
- Flow-based models (theory only)

Next to the code, under each assignment folder one can find my report (*Report.pdf*) outlining the theory and obtained results.

## Environments
A conda environment called `dl2020` is provided. It contains all packages needed for the course (practicals and tutorials). For your own computer, use the file [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/uvadlc/uvadlc_practicals_2020/blob/master/environment.yml) to create the environment. For your account on Lisa (UvA supercomputer), please use the file [`environment_Lisa.yml`](https://github.com/uvadlc/uvadlc_practicals_2020/blob/master/environment_Lisa.yml) which installs the environment `dl2020` with CUDA 10.1 support.
